# newrelic_redis_plugin

New Relic plugin for Redis in Ruby.

Unlike other plugins, it's simple and dedicated for Redis. Most of the statistics are available and built to run as a daemon with PID file and logging.

## Spec

Tested with:
- Ruby 2.0.0
- Gem: dante 0.2.0

## Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/kenjij/newrelic_redis_plugin/releases)
2. Extract to the location you want to run the agent from
3. Copy `config/template_newrelic_plugin.yml` to `config/newrelic_plugin.yml`
4. Edit `config/newrelic_plugin.yml` and replace "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE" with your New Relic license key

## Usage

Simply do `./newrelic_redis_agent` to run in the foreground. Other command line options are:

- `-d` – Run as daemon
- `-c FILE` – Designate a config file

## Config Options

Few configuration options are available in `config/newrelic_plugin.yml`.

- `instance_name` – Name of the instance that will be listed in New Relic; default: "HOSTNAME:PORT"
- `url` – Your Redis server; use "redis://127.0.0.1:6379" as default
- `database` – the database in which to lookup 'total keys'; use "db0" as default

### Example
``` yaml
agents:
  redis:
    instance_name: MyRedisServer
    url: redis://127.0.0.1:6379
    database: db0
```

## Chef Cookbook Available

A [Chef cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/newrelic_redis_plugin) is available for this plugin on Chef Supermarket.

The chef recipes build upon this plugin and add the ability to monitor multiple Redis instances
as well as providing init.d scripts to provide managed system services.
